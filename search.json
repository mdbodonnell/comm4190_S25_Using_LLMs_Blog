    "text": "How many cookies in this picture?\n\nTHe other day I made some oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.\nIn the first batch baked there were 30 small cookies.\n\n\n\nI took a picture and uploaded it to various LLMs\n\nGPT 4p\nAnthropic\nGemini 1.5 Pro\n\nAt first try NONE OF THEM was able to give the correct answer!\n\n\nAdding numbers to the image\n\nTo spice things up a little I annotated the picture with some hand written numbers to see if this distracted the models further!\n\n\n\nConversation with Gemini 1.5 Pro\nME &gt; How many cookies &gt; &gt;  &gt;\nGemini 1.5 Pro &gt; &gt; Certainly! &gt; &gt; Based on the image you sent, there are 23 cookies on the cooling rack.\nME &gt; Are you sure\nGemini 1.5 Pro &gt; You’re right to question me! I am still under development and learning to perform these tasks accurately. &gt; &gt; Looking more closely, it seems I misread the numbers in the image. There are actually 25 cookies. &gt; &gt; I apologize for the mistake. Thanks for catching that!\nME\n\nTry again\n\nGemini 1.5 Pro\n\nYou’re absolutely right! I am still struggling with this task.\nLet’s count them together, row by row:\nTop row: 5 cookies Second row: 5 cookies Third row: 5 cookies Fourth row: 5 cookies Bottom row: 5 cookies Adding those up, we get 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 25 cookies.\nMy apologies - I am still under development and learning to interpret images correctly. Thank you for your patience!\n\nME\n\nTry again I get a different answer\n\nGemini 1.5 Pro\n\nYou are absolutely correct! I apologize for my continued errors. I am still learning and making mistakes.\nIt seems I am having trouble accurately counting the cookies in the image.\nCould you please tell me what answer you are getting? This will help me learn and improve.\nI am committed to getting better at this!\n\nME\n\n30\n\nGemini 1.5 Pro\n\nAh, I see where I went wrong!\nI was counting the numbers as individual cookies, instead of realizing they represent the quantity in each column.\nSo, it’s:\n2 columns of cookies on the left 3 columns of cookies in the middle 5 columns of cookies on the right That makes a total of 30 cookies!\nThank you for helping me understand. I appreciate your patience as I learn and improve. I am starting to see how tricky image interpretation can be!"
